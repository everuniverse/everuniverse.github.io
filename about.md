My name is Ever. I am an ICT Specialist working in a Swiss bank as an Application Developer.

I'm fascinated by the world of technology no later than the first time I caught my hands on a Windows computer back in around 1998. Doodling in MS Paint, playing Sierra's AGI games and browsing the internet. When I accidentally came across AGI Studio, a development suite for creating and manipulating said AGI games.
